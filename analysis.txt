Courtesy a fine all-round performance with the ball, England restricted Australia to 147. The dashing opener, Craig Kieswetter then came out all guns blazing and hammered 63 off just 49 deliveries to take his team to a memorable seven-wicket win against their arch-rivals in the mega final. It is against this backdrop that the two historic rivals - Australia and England - will clash with one another at the very same venue in Bridgetown, Barbados in another T20 World Cup - on Saturday!

It is one of the biggest rivalries in cricketing history! The two great Ashes foes will battle it out in what will be a massive Group B encounter. England's washout against Scotland and the latter's win against Namibia has put the defending champions in a spot of bother. Australia meanwhile, registered a fairly comfortable win against Oman in their opening encounter. Australia would be hoping to become the first team to achieve the treble simultaneously - they are currently the ICC WTC Champions and the ICC World Cup winners too. They have won the T20 World Cup once - in 2021 in the UAE. England lifted the trophy twice - in 2010 and 2022. Both Australia and England have won four of their last five result-matches.

Starc has the unique ability to make inroads with the new ball - as he showcased against Oman too - and will be a handful in the overcast conditions on a helpful pitch in Barbados on Saturday.

Players who can make a Difference (England)
1. Jofra Archer
Jofra Archer can generate searing pace and bounce and could be a nightmare for the Australian batters with the new ball. Archer has picked 21 wickets in 18 T20Is for England at a strike rate of 19.3 and economy of 7.6.

2. Jonny Bairstow
Jonny Bairstow is one of the most feared hitters in international cricket and has an aggregate of 1561 runs in 66 innings for his country at an average of 30 and strike rate of 137.8. He has a strike rate of 138 against pace and 137 against spin.

Venue and Pitch
The pitch at the famous Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados will assist seamers in what are expected to be overcast conditions on Saturday. The mean temperature will be around 29 degrees. Interestingly, it is the spinners who have a better bowling average and economy at the venue. Bridgetown has already hosted four matches in the competition. Overall in all T20Is, the team batting first has won 17 while the team chasing has just won eight of the 28 matches at the venue. The average score batting first is 160 for 7 while the average score chasing is 140 for 7. The highest score at the venue is 224 - posted by the West Indies against England in 2022.

Match Prediction
It will be contest between England's batters and Australia's bowlers in Barbados. The battle between Starc and Hazlewood against Buttler and Salt in the powerplay will define the course of the match. Given the conditions and the nature of the pitch, expect Australia to make inroads with the new ball. Maxwell vs Rashid will be a key match-up in the middle-overs. In the final analysis, it is going to be very tight contest but England's batting depth might just give them than edge against their biggest rivals. England go into the match with a 60% chance of victory.

Fantasy XI
Glenn Maxwell will be a good choice for captain - not only does he have an excellent record against England and in T20I cricket, he will also be a more than useful bowler on the helpful track at Barbados. Jos Buttler could be a good vice-captain option given his numbers in T20 World Cup cricket. As a wicket-keeper he is also bound to add to his points with a few catches and stumpings.

Openers: TRAVIS HEAD, JOS BUTTLER (vc)

Batters: PHIL SALT, GLENN MAXWELL (c), JONNY BAIRSTOW

All-rounders: MITCHELL MARSH, MARCUS STOINIS
