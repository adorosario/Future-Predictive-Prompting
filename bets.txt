Cricket hasn‚Äôt traditionally been an obvious sport for bettors in the USA to wager on, but it has grown in popularity in recent years, so much so that the men‚Äôs T20 World Cup is jointly being hosted in the US and the West Indies. Starting in Dallas on Saturday, June 1st, the tournament began with the USA delighting the home crowd in thrashing Canada, and cricket betting sites in the USA will have wall-to-wall coverage of the rest of the tournament. The USA won their second game of the tournament with a remarkable Super Over victory over Pakistan giving them a very real chance of making it to the Super Eights. The fact Pakistan are now winless from two games means a win over Ireland would secure a spot in the next round for USA in their maiden world tournament.

While a few years ago it might not have been seen as a major sports betting event, the fact the country will be hosting 15 games in three different states ‚Äì Texas, Florida and New York ‚Äì this will be one of the biggest betting events of the summer, particularly so at the best New York betting sites, given sports betting is legal in the state. Ahead of the action getting underway, we‚Äôve put together the best T20 World Cup promos for you from the best sportsbooks in the country.

T20 World Cup Pick - USA vs India
Team USA has been the surprise package of the T20 World Cup thus far, thrashing Canada and then outlasting the mighty Pakistan in a Super Over. The team comes up against India next up hoping to secure an unlikely passage to the Super Eight phase of the first-ever major tournament. It might have to wait if India's form in the first two games is anything to go by, but it doesn't mean USA can't make it close.

Andries Gous has started brilliantly for the US, with 100 runs from the first two games. Rishabh Pant has seemingly enjoyed the additional responsibility on his shoulders this tournament, while Virat Kohli is almost always worth at least a few runs. This pick is predicated on India batting first really, but we think this same-game parlay could be good value.

Bet on Gous to score 10+ runs and both Pant and Kolhi to score 20+ runs at +330 with bet365.
